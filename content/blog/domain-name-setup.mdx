DRAFT 
Assigning unique domains for via google email for your business


DNS propogation of DKIM records takes some time! In our case - the first two attempts to create our car dealership website failed 
because we were too keen to start authentication of our DKIM records from google after puttin them in our domain host - name cheap.
In reality, after the DKIM record is generated (by google or someone else) and you add those to your domain host as a txt record,
it can take 60 minutes.

replace with DNS image map!

The three parts of the DKIM value must all be together without quotes.
The host name will be: "google._domainkey" for google workspace. 
The value will be in the format: =DKIM1; k=rsa; p=xxxxxx


If you are impatient - you can use a website to check the propogation of your TXT records to DNS sites across the world. Simply use
the website below and search for your 'TXT' records for your domain. This will show you an update across the world for 
your DNS propogation of your 'TXT' file. 

You shouldn't wait for all these to be 'green ticks' before attempting DNS DKIM resolution again via google workspaces. Google doesn’t require 100% global propagation
As long as your record is visible in most locations (and especially in the US), Google will usually authenticate once the record has propagated sufficiently.

If you run a car dealership, having a professional email address on your own domain (like rosh@autoro.space) isn’t just about looking professional—it’s about getting your emails into inboxes instead of spam.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to setting up your dealership email using Namecheap and Google Workspace, with all the tips we learned along the way.

Step 1: Buy a Domain

If you don’t already own one, buy a domain from a registrar like Namecheap. For example, autoro.space.

Your domain is your “digital storefront,” and your email will live on it.

A domain also lets you use your branding in all communications.

Step 2: Sign Up for Google Workspace

Go to Google Workspace
.

Choose Business Starter (~$7/month per user).

When asked for an admin email, you can temporarily use your personal Gmail. This is just for setup—your professional email will take over.

Set up your first user as your dealership email, e.g., rosh@autoro.space.

Step 3: Verify Your Domain

Google needs to know you own your domain.

Google will give you a TXT record.

Go to Namecheap → Domain List → autoro.space → Advanced DNS → Host Records.

Add a new TXT record:

Type: TXT

Host: @

Value: (paste Google’s verification string)

Save changes and click Verify in Google Workspace.

Note: DNS changes can take 5–60 minutes to propagate globally.

Step 4: Add MX Records (Google Mail Servers)

MX records direct your email to Google’s servers so you can send/receive from your dealership address.

Go to Namecheap → Advanced DNS → Host Records.

Remove existing MX records.

Add these Google MX records:

Type	Host	Value	Priority
MX	@	ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM	1
MX	@	ALT1.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM	5
MX	@	ALT2.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM	5
MX	@	ALT3.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM	10
MX	@	ALT4.ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM	10

TTL: Automatic

Step 5: Add DKIM Authentication

DKIM proves that your emails really come from your domain.

In Google Admin Console → Apps → Google Workspace → Gmail → Authenticate email.

Generate a 2048-bit DKIM key.

In Namecheap → Advanced DNS → Host Records → add TXT record:

Type: TXT

Host: google._domainkey

Value: (paste full DKIM key)

Save and click Start authentication in Google Admin.

Tip: It’s normal for some locations to show red in propagation tools at first. Wait 30–60 minutes.

Step 6: Add SPF Record

SPF tells mail servers which servers are allowed to send email on your behalf.

Add TXT record in Namecheap → Host Records:

Type: TXT

Host: @

Value:

v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all

Step 7: Add DMARC Record

DMARC monitors and protects your domain from spoofing.

Add TXT record in Namecheap → Host Records:

Type: TXT

Host: _dmarc

Value:

v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:rosh@autoro.space


Start with p=none so you can monitor before enforcing policies.

Step 8: Test Your Email

Send a test email from rosh@autoro.space to your personal email.

Check “Show original” in Gmail to confirm SPF, DKIM, and DMARC all PASS.

Step 9: Warm-Up Your Email Address

To avoid ending up in spam when sending outreach:

Day	Emails	Notes
1–2	10	Send test emails to yourself / colleagues
3–4	20	Include some replies from friends
5–7	30–50	Start sending small outreach emails
8–14	50–100	Ramp up gradually if engagement is good
15+	100+	Full outreach volume

Keep emails plain text, avoid images, 1–2 links max.

✅ Why This Matters for Car Dealerships

Professional branding in emails builds trust with potential buyers.

Proper email authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) prevents your emails from going to spam.

Warmed-up emails improve response rates for outreach campaigns like new inventory announcements or test-drive invites.

Now your dealership can email like a pro, build trust with customers, and make sure every message lands where it should — the inbox!

If you want, I can also add a simple visual diagram of the setup — showing Namecheap → Google Workspace → SPF/DKIM/DMARC → Inbox. That makes it much easier for dealership owners to understand at a glance.
