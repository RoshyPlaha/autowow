## Competition is fierce

Competition in the motortrade, like many other businesses, is fierce. And owners needs to consider how they can stand out in a crowded market.
Customer service is constantly evolving with the bar of standards increasing amongsts a crowded market.

## Bring a fresh UX for your customers

We do that in 4 core ways here at AutoRo. In this article we explain the core of AutoRo and why we are proud to offer premium car dealership websites for all. Note - this blog post does contain some technical elements. If you're unsure of any terminology or are just curious about AutoRo - feel free to reach out.

 ## 2 - A premium and smooth aesthetic.
 Last year (2024/5), in a canary version of the react framework - a new library was made available - `view transitions`. More details here: [View Transitions API](https://react.dev/reference/react/ViewTransition)
 ViewTransitions makes it possible to have seamless transitions as your user navigates through your car dealership website. Two popular examples of view-transitions used are on F1 drivers Lando Norris' site: [landonorris.com](https://landonorris.com/) and [nike.com](https://www.nike.com)

 On AutoRo.space - every click to a new page makes a seamless transition. Like a customer taking the cover off their new car! We elegantly place your company logo at the heart of each transition - reinforcing the your business at the heart of the car dealership user experience.

 ## 3 - Natural Language Search powered by GrokAI
2024 was the year where AI really became available to all to get consistent and relevant answers to their user queries (here I am referring to ChatGPT 3.5). Since then they are have been dozens of releases from Grok, DeepSeek, Gemini and others.
AutoRo was initially conceived to fix an issue with typical car dealership search capabilities in car websites.

At the current time of writing, a user needs to select from drop-downs and a series of filters to find cars. But, thats not how we as humans naturally search and think in day to day conversions. And we now live in a time where we can leverage the enhancement in natural language search and apply it to businesses.
I initially wrote a small article on medium ([Part 1](https://medium.com/@plaha.roshan/structuring-meaning-the-semantic-model-behind-natural-language-car-search-part-1-9cb11df203c6)) on how we can improve user experience within the domain of car search. This was quickly followed up by part 2 in the series where we dealt with even more complex scenarios across body colour, mileage, price. You can find the article here: [Part 2](https://medium.com/@plaha.roshan/dealing-with-increasingly-complex-user-input-creating-a-natural-language-car-search-part-2-781d0dabc0a3).

Car Dealership search needs to evolve into how user search in general is changing. Hence why this proprietary technology is embedded in all AutoRo websites. Note - there are some quirks and AutoRo car dealership search is constantly evolving. As trusted customers of our platform - we aim to release newer versions to you without any downtime of your existing sights.

## 4 - Insights that help shape your stock
We aim to publish different articles on this as its a complex topic. But our analytics enable your car dealership and our website to understand your customer search patterns like no other car template website before. We can:

- **Improve Customer Experience**: Customers find what they're looking for faster
- **Better Conversion Rates**: More relevant results lead to more sales
- **Valuable Insights**: Analytics reveal customer search patterns and buying intent

## The Future and closing thoughts

As AI continues to evolve, we can expect even more sophisticated search capabilities that will further enhance the car buying experience that car dealerships should take advantage of.
