## Background
In this project- I'm combining two passions of mine. Building tech and cars. The preface to this project is that I spend a lot of time on car trading websites - browsing for cars with all manner of specifications, price, age and rarity. The current website I use are Autotrader and Carandclassic. Whilst they provide an overall good user experience, I feel we are missing something in how we should be interacting with these websites in the advent of Large Language Model (LLM) commoditisation.

## Getting Started

```bash

Navigate to localhost:8080 and use or the credentials in the /localDB folder


Secondly, ensure you have nvm 20.11.1 or higher is installed.

Lastly, to start the web server and visit localhost:3000
